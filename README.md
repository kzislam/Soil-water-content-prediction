Soil moisture forecasting with various machine learning techniques

Farmers can benefit from forecasts of soil moisture.

In this experiment, I am going to apply multiple linear regression, support vector regression, and recurrent neural networks to estimate soil moisture according to weather forcast. 

Why Soil moisture is important for farming?
Soil moisture is vital in agricultural monitoring, drought and flood forecasting, forest fire prediction, water supply management, and other natural resource activities. Soil moisture observations can forewarn of impending drought or flood conditions before other more standard indicators are triggered.

Soil Moisture
Water contained in soil is called soil moisture. The water is held within the soil pores. Soil water is the major component of the soil in relation to plant growth. If the moisture content of the soil is optimum for plant growth, plants can readily absorb soil water. Not all the water held in the soil, is available to plants. Much of the water remains in the soil as a thin film. Soil water dissolves salts and makes up the soil solution, which is essential as medium for supply of nutrients to growing plants.
Importance of Soil Water
1.	Soil water serves as a solvent and carrier of food nutrients for plant growth
2.	Yield of crop is more often determined by the amount of water available rather than the deficiency of other food nutrients
3.	Soil water acts as a nutrient itself
4.	Soil water regulates soil temperature
5.	Soil forming processes and weathering depend on water
6.	Microorganisms require water for their metabolic activities
7.	Soil water helps in chemical and biological activities of soil
8.	It is a principal constituent of the growing plant
9.	Water is essential for photosynthesis

Retention of Water by Soil: The soils hold water (moisture) due to their colloidal properties and aggregation qualities. The water is held on the surface of the colloids and other particles and in the pores. The forces responsible for retention of water in the soil after the drainage has stopped are due to surface tension and surface attraction and are called surface moisture tension. This refers to the energy concept in moisture retention relationships. The force with which water is held is also termed as suction.
